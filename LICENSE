software according to _Distribution License_ and make changes
or new works based on the software according to _Changes and
New Works License_.

## Fair Use

You may have "fair use" rights for the software under the
law. These terms do not limit them.

## No Other Rights

These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of
your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from
granting licenses to anyone else. These terms do not imply
any other licenses.

## Patent Defense

If you make any written claim that the software infringes or
contributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license
for the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If
your employer makes such a claim, your patent license ends
immediately for work on behalf of your employer.

The first time you are notified in writing that you have
violated any of these terms, or done anything with the software
not covered by your licenses, the violations and your licenses
will not be automatically terminated if you come into

licenses end immediately.
